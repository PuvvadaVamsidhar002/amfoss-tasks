At first i have struggled a bit with the problem of being new to the this type of technology.and later due to the instructions and the links and references
it beacme a bit easy at start. But at the time of booting ubuntu i faced some issue with grub 
Then i tried alot of how to resolve and then i checked some youtube tricks and used those commands
Then my ubuntu has been started
But later when i restart again the grub issue is still present So then i checked alot and tried reinstalling ubuntu twice then i learned the mistake what i have done 
Is that the issue is due to the storage clash and also the quick startup option of windows was still on
so then after my ubuntu has no issue
hence i completed task-00
