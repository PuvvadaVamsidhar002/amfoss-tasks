Coding is the thing I wanted to do since my childhood and I want to be better in it so that I can aim higher and reach higher
My plan for the next 6 months is doing my best in academics and learning new things apart from the academic curriculum and get deeper into coding
I would try my best to contribute back to the club since it is the place where i am going to learn a lot of new things and explore a new world
The selection process is very good, In this process the steps the students going to complete , makes all the students to be on same starting line which will avoid any conflicts of someone going ahead and someone left behind
